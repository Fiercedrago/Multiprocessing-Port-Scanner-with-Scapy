# Multiprocessing Port Scanner with Scapy

This is a simple Python-based port scanner that uses the `scapy` library to send TCP SYN packets and determine open ports on a target machine. The script leverages multiprocessing to scan multiple ports in parallel, significantly speeding up the process.

## Features
- **SYN Scan:** Identifies open ports by sending TCP SYN packets and listening for SYN-ACK responses.
- **Multiprocessing:** Uses `multiprocessing.Pool` to scan ports concurrently for faster results.
- **Timeout Handling:** Configurable timeout for unresponsive ports, preventing the script from stalling.
- **Error Handling:** Includes exception handling for network issues or invalid configurations.
- **Scalable:** Easily adjust the port range to scan by modifying the `target_ports` variable.

## How It Works
- **`scan_port()`**: Sends a TCP SYN packet to a specific port. If it receives a SYN-ACK, the port is considered open and the port number is returned.
- **`port_scan()`**: Distributes port scanning tasks across multiple processes using `multiprocessing.Pool`, returning a list of open ports.
- **Main Execution**: Scans the first 1000 ports on `127.0.0.1` by default but can be easily configured to scan any target or range of ports.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library (Install using `pip install scapy`)
- Network access to the target machine

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiprocessing-port-scanner.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Usage
1. Modify the `target` variable in `port_scanner.py` to the IP address you want to scan.
2. Adjust the `target_ports` range as needed.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
   ```

The script will output a list of open ports, if any are found, or notify you if no open ports are detected.

## Example
```bash
python port_scanner.py
Open ports: [22, 80, 443]
```
